Part 1
1. What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using engineering principles to create reliable and efficient systems.
2. Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry
Software engineering is crucial because it ensures the creation of high-quality, secure, and adaptable software, which is essential for businesses to stay competitive.
3. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
Key milestones include the creation of high-level programming languages, the introduction of structured programming, and the rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
4. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The SDLC includes Planning, Requirements Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance, each ensuring a systematic approach to software development.
5. Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Waterfall is a step-by-step approach for stable projects, while Agile is flexible and iterative, ideal for projects with evolving requirements.
6. Roles and Responsibilities in a Software Engineering Team
A Software Developer writes code, a QA Engineer tests the software, and a Project Manager ensures the project stays on track and meets goals.
7. Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS)
IDEs like Visual Studio help with coding and debugging, while VCS like Git manage code changes and team collaboration.
8. Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers and Strategies to Overcome Them
Challenges include changing requirements, debugging, and staying updated; overcome these with flexible methods, systematic debugging, and continuous learning.
9. Different Types of Testing in Software Quality Assurance
Testing includes Unit, Integration, System, and Acceptance Testing, all essential for ensuring software quality and meeting user needs.
